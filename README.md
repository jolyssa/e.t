This project was designed to increase student engagement for lunchtime and after-school study sessions on a Cree reserve in Quebec. The site provides key information about who we are, what we do, where to find us, and how to get in touch. By using flyers with QR codes around the school, we attracted students to explore the site and increased participation in our sessions.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
This site was built as a way to address student recruitment issues for lunchtime and after-school study sessions on a Cree reserve in Quebec. I developed it using my existing skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a site that students would be curious to explore by promoting it around the school using flyers with a QR code. The design was simple and focused on delivering key information such as who we are, what we do, where to find us, and how to contact us.

I used HTML for structuring the content of the website, including sections for about us, our services, and contact details. CSS was used to style the site, ensuring it was visually appealing and would catch students' attention while maintaining simplicity for usability. For some interactive elements, like animations or hover effects, I integrated JavaScript to make the site feel more dynamic and engaging.

Tracking the site’s metrics was also important. I implemented simple analytics to monitor how many people were visiting the site, which helped us confirm that students were indeed scanning the QR code and exploring what we had to offer. It was exciting to see this traction, which motivated us to continue our recruitment efforts.

## Optimisations:
The project initially began as a mobile-only design since I noticed most students were constantly on their phones. I wanted to meet them where they were most likely to access the site, making it as easy and convenient as possible to learn about our services. I plan to make it for desktop in the future.

Additionally, I made sure the site’s key messaging was front and center, focusing on what we offer and how to get involved. To encourage more students to visit our tutoring sessions, I added small interactive features to the site, such as a weekly schedule and upcoming event highlights, which helped create more excitement about our activities. These elements made the site not only informative but also engaging, motivating students to stop by and see what we were up to in person.

## Lessons Learned:
Building this site taught me a lot about problem-solving through technology. The biggest lesson was that even a simple website can make a significant impact when targeted and marketed correctly. I learned how to creatively use my existing skills to solve a real-world problem—getting students interested in our study sessions.

Working with limited resources, I also learned to prioritise simplicity and efficiency. I focused on the core functionality and message rather than over-complicating the site. On the technical side, I gained more confidence in using JavaScript for enhancing user interactions and further solidified my HTML and CSS skills.

Most importantly, this project reinforced the value of measuring the effectiveness of your solutions. By tracking the metrics of the site, we could see that our strategy was working, which was a great motivator and validation of the effort we put into the project.
